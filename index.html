    <h1>The Yamaha TZR 250 2MA</h1>
    <h2>This is a nice example of a 1988 model.</h2>

    <p>The Yamaha TZR250 is a motorcycle manufactured and produced by the Japanese motorcycle manufacturer Yamaha between 1986 and 1995.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Power: 45 hp (34 kW) (restricted)</li>
        <li>Wheelbase: 	54.1 in (1,370 mm)</li>
        <li>Weight: 280 lb (127 kg)[1] (dry) / 320 lb (150 kg)[1] (wet)</li>
      </ul>
    <p>Yamaha produced the road going two-stroke motorcycle, loosely based on the TZ250 Yamaha racing bike (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yamaha_TZR250">resource from wikipedia</a>). Parallel-twin, reverse cylinder and finally 90Â° V-twin variants were produced. It evolved as a natural replacement for the popular RD 250/Yamaha RD350LC series of the 1980s.</p>
